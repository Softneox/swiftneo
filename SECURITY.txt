   - Certificate SHA-1: AB:CD:EF:12:34:56:78:90:AB:CD:EF:12:34:56:78:90:AB:CD:EF:12

2. FILE INTEGRITY (SHA-256)
   - File: SwiftNeo_v1.0.0.apk
   - Hash: a1b2c3d4e5f678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef

================================================================================
KNOWN LIMITATIONS & RISKS
================================================================================

1. THIRD-PARTY CONTENT
   SwiftNeo does not host or modify video content. All media is streamed
   directly from YouTube's official servers. Content safety is YouTube's
   responsibility.

2. YOUTUBE API CHANGES
   If YouTube changes their website structure, SwiftNeo may temporarily
   stop working until updated. This is not a security issue.

3. DEVICE SECURITY
   SwiftNeo cannot protect against:
   • Rooted/jailbroken devices with compromised security
   • Malware already present on the device
   • Network-level attacks (use HTTPS/Wi-Fi security)
   • Physical access to your device

4. LEGAL COMPLIANCE
   Users are responsible for complying with YouTube's Terms of Service and
   local copyright laws. SwiftNeo is for PERSONAL, NON-COMMERCIAL use only.

================================================================================

• NO user accounts or authentication
• NO analytics or usage tracking
• NO crash reporting to external servers
• NO cloud storage or sync
• NO advertising SDKs or trackers
• NO network calls beyond YouTube video streaming
• NO data shared with third parties

All data (download history, settings, cache) is stored 100% locally on your
device using Hive (encrypted key-value storage). No data leaves your device.
