================================================================================
NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS
================================================================================

SwiftNeo ONLY communicates with the following endpoints:

1. YOUTUBE.COM / YOUTUBEI.GOOGLEVIDEO.COM
   Purpose: Stream video/audio content directly from YouTube
   Data Sent: Standard HTTP requests for video URLs

   Purpose: Render YouTube website for browsing/searching
   Data Sent: Search queries, page navigation
   Data Received: YouTube web pages, video listings
   Note: Subject to YouTube's own privacy policy

3. NO OTHER NETWORK CALLS
   SwiftNeo makes NO calls to:
   • Softneox servers or domains
   • Analytics services (Google Analytics, Firebase, etc.)
   • Crash reporting services (Crashlytics, Sentry, etc.)
   • Advertising networks or trackers
   • Cloud storage or sync services
   • Any third-party APIs beyond YouTube

================================================================================
PERMISSIONS & DATA ACCESS

SwiftNeo requests ONLY these permissions (all essential for core features):

1. INTERNET
   Access: Network connectivity
   Data Impact: Allows streaming from YouTube
   Privacy Risk: LOW (standard for any internet app)

================================================================================
THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
================================================================================

SwiftNeo does NOT integrate with ANY third-party services for:

• Analytics or user tracking
• Crash reporting or error monitoring
• Advertising or monetization
• Cloud storage or backup
• Social media sharing (beyond Android system share)
• Authentication or user accounts
• Content delivery networks (CDN)
• Push notifications

The ONLY external service SwiftNeo interacts with is YouTube itself, for the
purpose of streaming video/audio content. This interaction is direct and
unmediated - we do not proxy or intercept YouTube traffic.

================================================================================
OPEN-SOURCE DEPENDENCIES
================================================================================

SwiftNeo uses these open-source libraries (all privacy-respecting):

• youtube_explode_dart - Extracts YouTube video URLs (no tracking)
• dio - HTTP client (no telemetry)
• just_audio - Audio playback (local only)
• chewie - Video player UI (no tracking)
• hive - Local encrypted storage (100% offline)
• path_provider - Access device storage (Android standard)

None of these libraries collect or transmit user data. All are well-audited
and widely used in the Flutter community.

================================================================================
DATA RETENTION & DELETION
================================================================================

LOCAL DATA RETENTION:
• Download history: Until you delete downloads or clear history
• App settings: Until app uninstall or manual reset
• Cache: Automatically managed by Android system
• Search history: Until cleared by user (if enabled)

DELETING YOUR DATA:
1. Clear individual downloads: Long-press download → Delete
2. Clear all history: Settings → Clear History
3. Clear all  Android Settings → Apps → SwiftNeo → Storage → Clear Data
4. Complete removal: Uninstall SwiftNeo (deletes ALL app data)

After uninstall, NO data remains on your device except downloaded files you
explicitly saved to your gallery/downloads folder (which you control).

================================================================================
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
================================================================================

SwiftNeo is not intended for children under 13. However, since we collect NO
personal data whatsoever, there is no risk of children's data being collected
or misused. Parents can use SwiftNeo without concern about data privacy.

================================================================================
POLICY UPDATES
================================================================================

This privacy policy may be updated if SwiftNeo's functionality changes.
However, our commitment to ZERO data collection will NEVER change.

If we ever introduce features that require data collection (highly unlikely),
we will:
1. Update this policy with clear explanations
2. Require explicit opt-in consent from users
3. Provide options to disable data collection
4. Maintain transparency about what data is collected and why

Current policy version: 1.0.0 (February 7, 2026)

================================================================================
YOUR RIGHTS

(access, rectification, erasure, portability) are not applicable.

However, you have these rights:

✓ Right to use offline: All features work without internet (except streaming)
✓ Right to delete locally: Clear any data stored on your device anytime
✓ Right to uninstall: Remove app and all associated data completely
✓ Right to inspect: SwiftNeo is closed-source but uses only open-source
